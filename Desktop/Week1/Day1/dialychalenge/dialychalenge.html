         <span class="thor"> THOR ODINSON</span>

     <span>"Thor is the "God of Thunder",a member of the race known as the Asgardians, <br>
    a group of humanoid beings from the pocket dimension of Asgard, the Realm Eternal.<br>
    Thor is the son of Odin, the All-Father and king of Asgard. He was worshiped by the humans<br> known as 
    Vikings and became part of Norse Mythology. Armed with his enchanted Uru hammer Mjolnir,<br>
    which helps him to channel his godly energies, he became the mightiest warrior in the Ten Realms.<br>
    When his irresponsible and impetuous behavior became too much, Odin sent him to Midgard<br>
    (more commonly known as Earth) as a disabled mortal medical student named Donald Blake,<br>
    stripped of his memory. After learning humility he regained his memory as well as his godly powers.<br>
    Thor went on to become a champion for Midgard as well as one of the founding members of the Avengers, <br>
    "Earth's Mightiest Heroes".</span>
